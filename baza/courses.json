There are no prerequisites for this course — in it you'll explore the laws of physics and principles of engineering and learn the rules as you play. There will be plenty of surprises along the way, but by the end you'll have gained the understanding and insight to look at the world in a different way.","image":"b73f23b8-b0f7-44e2-b006-84407a518fdf","lessons":[],"shortDescription":"Open your eyes to the world around you by solving puzzles with science.","tests":[],"students":["student@student.com"]}

The focus, here, is on the physical observations that inspired Maxwell's famous field equations, which tell us how electric and magnetic fields operate across the universe.","image":"195a161b-c97f-4ebb-a1d8-936ce1ef43d3","lessons":[],"shortDescription":"Discover what powers the devices you use, from your toaster to your cell phone.","tests":[],"students":[]}
